Welcome to the System Programming Class!
We have learned about File System Calls.
There are many kinds of File System Calls such as open, read, write, lseek etc.
These system calls are used at files in which we make some sentences.
If you are skilled at these calls, You can make some commands about files.
The class will end of this point.
Thank you for listening my class.
Good Bye!
